# Application - Basketball team selector

## Main Problem

Organizing basketball teams for amateur groups manually is a time-consuming
process that often produces unbalanced games. Players quickly lose interest when
they repeatedly end up on the same teams, leading to predictable matchups and
decreased engagement. AI-powered team generation can solve both problems by
creating balanced and varied lineups quickly and efficiently.

## Minimum Feature Set

- Support for one player group only (approximately 20 players)
- AI-powered team generation based on player skill levels and positions
- Manual adjustments to AI-generated team propositions
- Creating games by date, generating multiple AI team propositions (e.g., 3
  options), and selecting which lineup will be played
- Player management: adding new players and updating skill levels
- Simple user account system with two roles: Admin (full player management) and
  User (view-only access)
- Simple statistic of how many games each player has played and won

## What is NOT included in the MVP scope

- Support for multiple player groups
- Player feedback system (ratings, comments on games or team propositions)
- Advanced statistics and analytics (e.g., player performance tracking over
  time)
- Advanced statistics (e.g., player performance over time)
- Advanced AI features (learning from past games, player chemistry modeling)
- Integrations with external platforms (calendar apps, league management
  systems)

## Success Criteria

- At least one proposition for each game is accepted by admin with minimal
  manual adjustments
- Game creation and team selection process takes less than 5 minutes
